## Getting Started



### Prerequisites	

To create this project I used Python, Django, DRF, PostgresSQL

### Installing

Well, at the beginning you need to clone my repositories and insert it in "Version Control" in Pycharm, then you need to create venv "python -m venv venv", then install all requirements "pip install -r requirements.txt", then you need to make migrations
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
And after all the guides you need to create superuser "python manage.py createsuperuser" and after creating, you just need to start the project "python manage.py runserver".
