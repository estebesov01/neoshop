This project was designed for online shopping.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To create this project I used Python, Django, DRF, PostgresSQL

Installing
Well, at the beginning you need to clone my repositories and insert it in "Version Control" in Pycharm, then you need to create venv "virtualenv venv", then install all requirements "pip install -r requirements.txt", then you need to make migrations

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
And after all the guides you need to create superuser "python manage.py createsuperuser" and after creating, you just need to start the project "python manage.py runserver".
